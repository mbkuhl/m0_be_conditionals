1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
When there is a condition in which a task is performed.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
If I could do it over (and had more time and sleep) I would do the spicy challenge. Seems like fun.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
I enjoy doing the challenges. I want to do more, but I'm running very low on time.
